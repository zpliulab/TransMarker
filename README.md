# TransMarker: Unveiling dynamic network biomarkers in cancer progression through cross-state graph alignment and optimal transport

**TransMarker** is a computational framework for detecting dynamic biomarkers in cancer progression using single-cell data. It models disease states as multilayer networks, aligns regulatory shifts across states, and identifies genes with evolving regulatory roles.

## Highlights:
- **Dynamic biomarker discovery:** Identifies state-specific genes with shifting regulatory roles during cancer progression.

- **Multilayer network modeling:** Encodes each disease state as a separate layer, integrating gene expression with prior biological interactions.

- **Cross-state alignment:** Uses Gromovâ€“Wasserstein optimal transport to quantify structural shifts of genes across disease states.

- **Dynamic Network Index (DNI):** Introduces a new metric to capture regulatory variability and prioritize dynamic network biomarkers.

- **Deep learning integration:** Combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) for contextual embedding and disease state classification.

- **Robust validation:** Demonstrated superior performance on simulated and real single-cell gastric adenocarcinoma datasets, outperforming existing multilayer ranking approaches.

- **Biological relevance:** Detects genes that reflect meaningful rewiring of gene regulation, providing insight into molecular drivers of cancer progression.
